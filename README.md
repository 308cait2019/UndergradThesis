An Examination of Lake Erie’s ”Western Basin Occupying”
Yellow and White Perch Populations from a Graph Theory
Perspective

Although Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes life-rich ecosystems, its traits are continually
tracked and analyzed to ensure future freshwater health. A key lies in understanding the
development of native and invasive fish populations. With that knowledge, we may compare
these populations to consecutively smaller or larger organism dynamics. Gathering research that
analyzes freshwater systems is how national organizations tackle freshwater issues. A typical
avenue of investigation utilizes data collection and statistical analysis to determine species
relationships. Instead, we apply an avenue of approach via graph theory. We gather data on Lake
Erie’s western basin, allowing examination of the native white and yellow perch populations’
analogous or cross-pernicious trends, finding they are due to diet and ecosystem health agents.

Attached is as follows. 
1. Jupyter Notebooks where file names correspond to paper figures. 
2. One R code file for the histograms or plots that determined the prey weight thresholds or analysis cutoff points.
3. Data
   - 2014 sample data on consumed Zebra and Quagga mussel shell and flesh dry weights and related biological data
   - Multi-year Lake Erie phytoplankton data and related biological data
   - Prey consumed by the White and Yellow perch species and related biological data
